-------------------------------------

In some situation you just want to affect a group of boolean.
In the following situation, we try to make some mapping and some context
```
//The following group, allow to set some target context to manage the kind of power to use in a game.
target ♦ onetarget twotarget multitarget ♦  ☗AllFalseByDefault ☗SetTrue onetarget 

//The following group allow to make some layer to your macro.
mapping ♦ map1 map2 map3 map4 map5  ♦ ☗AllTrueByDefault ☗SetFalse map1
 
```

To manipulate those group, you can use the following commands
```
//A ♦ AA AB AC AD
//A :1 1 0 0    >   A :0 0 0 0 
boolgroup:false:A

//A ♦ AA AB AC AD
//A :1 1 0 0   >   A :1 1 1 1 
boolgroup:true:A

//A ♦ AA AB AC AD
//A :1 1 0 0   >   A :0 0 1 1 
boolgroup:switch:A

//A ♦ AA AB AC AD
//A :1 1 0 0   >   A :0 1 0 0 
//boolgroup:true:A:AB

//A ♦ AA AB AC AD
//A :1 1 0 0   >   A :1 0 1 1 
//boolgroup:false:A:AB

```

If you want to make is more fast to use you can user .stringtocommands
```
wow:onetarget ♦ boolgroup:true:target:onetarget
wow:doubletarget ♦ boolgroup:true:target:doubletarget
wow:severaltarget ♦ boolgroup:true:target:multitarget 

//Call it with the macro interpretor
macro:wow:doubletarget

```
