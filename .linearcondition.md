Linear Condition is a good bad idea. 
The idea was to allow to quickly request action based on the following of some condition.
In theory it is a good idea.
In practice, it conflict often with the rest. For example

```
// I tried to say if you press left then up then right
LeftArrow ➤ UpArrow  ➤ RightArrow ♦ debuglog Test ♦ GlobalExitTime 2000 ☗BreakTime 100 ☗StepExitTime 1000 ☗TriggerOnFound ☗TriggerOnExit

//The problems
// - If the user press them all, it true true.
// - You need to precise some break time to reset it when possible 
// - It bug easily if you do Left  ➤ Left  ➤ Left because it make the hall statement in one way
// - If you do righ > up > left three time quickly it trigger the left > up > right...
// - ...

// A solution is to be precise but it make it so long and so boring to deal with.
// And that only for simple Left  ➤ Up  ➤ Down
LeftArrow + !UpArrow + !RightArrow  ➤    !LeftArrow + UpArrow + !RightArrow ➤  !LeftArrow + !UpArrow + RightArrow ♦ debuglog Test ♦ GlobalExitTime 2000 ☗BreakTime 100 ☗StepExitTime 20000 ☗TriggerOnFound ☗TriggerOnExit
```



If you still want to use it:
- ☗GlobalExitTime 2000 It if take more that 2 seconds to do the conditions it exit and restart waiting
- ☗BreakTime 100 A time where the detection is paused after each valide condition
- ☗StepExitTime 1000  if the condition of a state is superiors to 1000ms then stop tracking and restart waiting.
- ☗TriggerOnFound   as soon as the final state if found, trigger the action
- ☗TriggerOnExit  as soon as the exit time is reach it check if we are in the final condition and it is true.
- ☗Cooldown 1000 time in milliseconds before it reset the statement.
- Left  ➤ Up  ➤ Down when left is true, check up. When up is true check down. When down is true wait.
