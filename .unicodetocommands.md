Send on the network:
- jomi:Eâ†“ Eâ†‘
- macro:doom:playsound
- ...
Can be a bandwidth problem if it is not sporadic.

If you plan to use heavily your network to control devices.
I tip your to use the .unicodetoactions like follow;
```
ðŸŽµâ™¦macro:doom:playsoundâ™¦debuglog Play music of doom.
ðŸš€â™¦jomi:Eâ†“ Eâ†‘â™¦debuglog Fire rocket
ðŸ’¡â™¦window:shutdownâ™¦debuglog Shutdown the computer
```
It like a unicode symbole that you can send on the network like such
`ÅªðŸš€`

As soon as the device received a network package like this one ÅªðŸš€.
He will try to find the local command lines associate to it and play them.

It is very like .stringtocommandlines except that it is mush faster to detect for your computer but less readable and sharable for human.
