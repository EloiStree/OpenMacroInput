## Warning

Before we start ⚠️ BIG WARNING CLAIM ⚠️. 
- This tools is reading you keyboard and mouse to assist you. If you don't trust me, don't use my application. 
  - All my code are Open source so you can overwatch them if you want.
- If you use an application from someone using my code, if you don't trust them, don't use their application.
  - This project is open source meaning that anybody can do they own version. I am not responsible of their illigale actions.
- This code is in development and as I don't have the budjet or the skills for hacker protection. Don't expect hacker protection. You are on your own if someone hack my tool to kack your computer. 

**Why I am so thrustfull on the subject?**  
My tool is very powerfull and useful. And I know it. But I aware that it is also **very very very dangerous** as it allows hacker that want to harm you to hack you very powerfully.

On that said... good exploration of this tool :)


## Developer Warning

Current license of use:
```
There are none.
I am  waiting to know how to write one be able to write it.
In a second time, I am waiting to be able hire a lawyer to write an official one that translate my way of seeing the open source and the free-to-use part of the project, before proposing one public to the community for validation.
So, for the moment, feel free to use it like you want but not-commercialy and consider that I am not responsible of any bug or maintaining until future official license.
Feel free to enjoy it for fun :)
```

- All my code are open source... But I am not assuming at all bug and malfunction. 
  - Bad code are fast until it makes everything slow. So I code bad code to learn and rewrite good code later when I think I know the topic enough. 
- You are not suppose to `fork` >-> `use` . You are suppose to `fork` >-> `make it your own` >-> `use`.  
- I am not coding to have a community using it. I am coding for me but I let the commmunity using it. 
  - Meaning, that I accept people working with me on it but I don't want to spend to much time doing that.
    -  I plan to have several points where you can hook your own code on mine. If you see better ways to do it, I invite you to contact and work with me to add those hooks.: **"Less people need me, more we are are happy"**.
  - Meaning, that my scheduling is:
    - 75% working and thinking on innovation to implement code
    - 15% refactoring and keeping the code as clean as I can
    - 10% other stuffs: documenting, communicating, maintenaing ...
  - Meaning, that if you want me to code something, the best way is to make me want to code it by talking to me about it on vocal discord.
