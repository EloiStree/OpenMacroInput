Ouh... That a hard topic.  
If you fall on this page, it means that you requested XBox instruction.  
But as you did not installed the SCP vBus that simulate the controller, you can't.  

If you know how to code a tool that don't need that, ping me:

Until then...    

I invite you to install the following tools:  
- https://github.com/bayangan1991/PYXInput/tree/master/pyxinput/ScpVBus-x64  
- https://github.com/bayangan1991/PYXInput/tree/master/pyxinput/ScpVBus-x86  
(If you still want to simulate Xbox controller)
