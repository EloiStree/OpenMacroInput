This file is very handy when you want to execute action without being on the computer.

You can subscribe to two types of timer:
- Specific time of the day
  - At 12:30
  - At 12h 30m 50s 500ms
- Specific frequency of the day
  - 1Second, 2Seconds, 3Seconds, 4Seconds, 5Seconds
  - 10Seconds, 15Seconds, 20Seconds, 30Seconds
  - 1Minute, 2Minutes, 3Minutes, 4Minutes, 5Minutes
  - 10Minutes, 15Minutes, 20Minutes, 30Minutes
  - 1Hour, 2Hours, 3Hours, 4Hours, 6Hours

The following line:    
`Every 5 minutes ♦ AntiAFK + InGame ♦ jomie: Space↓ Space↑`  
Will jump every 5 minutes if the boolean "AntiAFK" is true and the user is in his game.  

The following lines:  
`At 03:55 ♦ RelogEveryday + InGame ♦ macro:game:quitgame`  
`At 04:00 ♦ RelogEveryday ♦ macro:game:launchgame`  
`At 04:05 ♦ RelogEveryday ♦ macro:game:logingame`  
Will quite the game and relaunch it everyday at around four o'clock in the morning.  
Only if the user requested it by setting the boolean "RelogEveryday" to true.  

If the line don't contain condition, it will just execute at the given time:  
`At 00:00  ♦ debuglog It is midnight and everything is all right.`
