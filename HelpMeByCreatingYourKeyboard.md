So basically, you can create your keyboard for a very low amount of money.
Mine are from 5-30â‚¬ in production cost but required me to work on them for 1-8 hours.

I invite your to make your own and will link here some tutorial on how to do them and connect them to OMI.

To make your keyboard you will need to buy some hardware component.
You can buy them in store, but I bet you are going to buy them on Amazon, AliExpress or alternative.

If this is the case, then you can help me back by using affiliation link(s).
Basically it gives pourcentage of what people buy on the store.

For example, here are the tool I use to build my keyboard:
- Arduino Nano: https://amzn.to/3nZJMGH
- Resistance of 330ohm 2.2k ohm 1k ohm 1m ohm: https://amzn.to/2IZ8jgd
- "Fil de laiton" https://amzn.to/3nZhkV4
- Soldering Cable https://amzn.to/2HENgPk
