This file allows to track the intensity of a microphone.

For example `Stereo♦FishingSound♦0.05♦1`
- Check if a microphone contain "Stereo" in it name
- Store the boolean value in "FishingSound"
- Store the value as true if the intensity is from 5-100%

File example:
```
//This line listen to the output of my computer/game
//It allows to trigger some fishing macro when needed. 
Stereo♦FishingSound♦0.05♦1

//This line listen to my voice.
//It allows to trigger action based on sequences of noise.
H1♦MeTalking♦0.05♦1
```

PS: if you are a window developer and you know how to track the intensity of output or the window audio mixer in C#. Please contact me.
I would like to add the possibility to track the output sound more precisely for many reasons.
