This file allows to be sure that some booleans exist and set them with a default value.
It also allows to change the logic of your code when you need to change it from time to time.

Here are some example:
```
// If you need your logic to make no sound
SoundAllow ♦ true
// If you want to be sure that some logic don't execute when you are streaming
IsStreaming ♦ false

// Give information on what kind of character you are playing with for the moment
PlayingWarrior ♦ false
PlayingMage ♦ false
PlayingHunter ♦ true

// Give information on what language you are coding with for the moment
CodeInCSharp ♦ true
CodeInJava ♦ false

```
_Don't forget that it is just some tag you can use in your logic._
